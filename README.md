# Full-Wave Voltage Multiplier power supplies

<img src="AdjustablePSU/doc/AdjustablePSU_Assembled.jpg" align="left" height="250" width="250" >

This page contains a design for a bipolar (split +/- voltage rail) linear power supply. It uses variable linear regulators so the output voltage can be set by changing 4 of the resistors.

Since the board above only contains two IDC outputs, there is also an extension board

Both are suitable for use with modular synths systems or as standalone fixed power supplies.
