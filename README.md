# FullWaveVoltageMultiplierPSU
"Full-Wave Voltage Multiplier" designs. 

## Fixed dual linear power supply with 6 IDC sockets

- 12VDC output
- Ripple current 0.7Vpp @ 1A output (per rail). Appropriately current-rated components must be used. Ripple will decrease with current output.  Heatsink is required!

## Programmable dual linear power supply

- 5VDC output
- Ripple current 0.5vpp @ 1A output (per rail). Appropriately current-rated components must be used. Ripple will decrease with current output.  Heatsink is required!
- For 12VDC output change resistors R_NEGREG2 and R_POSREG2 from 390Ω to 1KΩ
